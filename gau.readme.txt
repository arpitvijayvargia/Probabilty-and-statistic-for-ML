Method to find MVU using livlihood function:


Step1:-     Withdraw a sample from the population(whoose probabilty distribution is the one for which you want to find the mvu estimator for). let the sample size equal to N.  In our example we assuming that the population is gausian distributed because we want the MVU estimator of natural Parameter of Gausian Distribution.


Step 2:-    We will make the assumption that the sample which is withdrawn from the population , in that sample each observation is IID(Independent and Identically Distributed)


Step 3:-   Construct the expression (formula) for Likelihood function for the sample.


Step 4:- find the maxima for likelihood function which Maximizes the value of function.

step5:- Because as we will See in near future that the likelihood function "Will always come out to be the function of natural Parameter of a distribution" . Therefore , the expression which we will get after finding the global maxima will be the MVU estimator.
